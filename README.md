# Low-Level-Design-Applications
This repository contains console level application using low level design Principles.
It seems like the markdown rendering on GitHub or another platform may not be displaying the bullet points correctly. Here's the corrected version with proper markdown syntax for bullet points:

## üìú About  
This is a **Low-Level Design (LLD)** application that demonstrates the application of object-oriented principles and design patterns to develop a scalable and efficient system. The goal of this application is to break down high-level requirements into detailed components and classes that are easy to understand and implement.

- **Designed to address common software challenges** such as data management, processing logic, and scalability.  
- **Follows best practices** in design patterns, SOLID principles, and clean code guidelines.  

## üîß Features  
- **Modular Design**: The application is structured with modules to separate concerns, making it easier to maintain and scale.  
- **Design Patterns**: Implements common design patterns like:
  - Factory  
  - Singleton  
  - Observer  
  - Strategy  
  These patterns provide efficient solutions for common problems.  
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle increasing loads and adaptable to growing requirements.  
- **Object-Oriented Principles**: Focuses on:
  - Encapsulation  
  - Inheritance  
  - Polymorphism  
  To create clean, reusable, and maintainable code.  

## üßë‚Äçüíª How It Works  
It uses the following approaches to design the components:
- **Class and Object Design**: Defines entities and their relationships.  
- **Method and Interface Design**: Specifies the behavior and responsibilities of each component.  
- **Data Flow**: Establishes how data is passed between objects and modules in the system.
